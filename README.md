# Binary Tree Inversion

This repository contains a Python code that implements the inversion of a binary tree. Inverting a binary tree involves swapping the positions of left and right child nodes at each node in the tree. This results in a mirrored tree, where branches that were on the left are now on the right, and vice versa.
